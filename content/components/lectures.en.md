These pre-recorded videos are released on Mondays and are comprised of course content and weekly "State of the IDS" videos (recap of previous week, what’s coming in the new week, frequently asked questions). You’re expected to watch (and learn from) them before Friday’s workshops. 

To keep your learning active, you’ll have the chance to work on unmarked application exercises. Similar to assessment material on the course, these repositories can be _cloned_ from the course <a id="ids2021Git">GitHub page</a> and completed using <a id="RStudioCloud">RStudio Cloud</a> (see <a id="OpeningaProject">Opening a Project</a> for instructions).
