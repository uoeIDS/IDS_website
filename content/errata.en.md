### Week 1

<p id="W105"><strong>IDS - Week 01 - 05 - Meet the toolkit: programming</strong></p>

- The video is very quiet due to an error when rendering the video! We recommend making sure you do not have any other programs that cause notifications open as these will be quite loud. This issue is resolved in future weeks videos.
- This year to work on application exercises, you need to _clone_ them from their git repository (see Opening a Project) or watch video 02.

<p id="W106"><strong>IDS - Week 01 - 06 - Meet the toolkit: version control and collaboration</strong></p>

- The video is very quiet (see above).
- Signing up to GitHub looks a tad different than demoed in the video, but asks for largely the same information.

### Week 2

<p id="W202"><strong>IDS - Week 02 - 02 - Data and visualisation</strong></p>

- At 8:30, it is mentioned that Wilkinson's The Grammar of Graphics (available through DiscoverEd for free) is the inspiration for `ggplot2`. It should be additionally noted that the author of `ggplot2`, Hadley Wickham, "proposes an alternative parameterization of the grammar, based around the idea of building up a graphic from multiple layers of data. The grammar differs from Wilkinson’s in its arrangement of the components, the development of a hierarchy of defaults, and in that it is embedded inside another programming language.". See <a id="LayeredGG">A Layered Grammar of Graphics</a> for details.

<p id="W206"><strong>IDS - Week 02 - 06 - AE: StarWars + Dataviz</strong></p>

- Instead of having the application exercises up on RStudio Cloud already, this year we are asking that you "clone" them from their GitHub repositories. This is so you get more practice cloning repositories.
