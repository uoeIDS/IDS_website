Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

We've already prepared instructions for dealing with common questions, so feel free to check that out first on the <a id="troubleshoot">Setup & Troubleshooting</a> page.

- **Piazza:** The best way to get any questions answered in a timely manner on course content, technology, logistics, and policies is to post your question on <a id="Piazza">Piazza</a>. You are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well. For more information on using Piazza, please see the <a id="PiazzaHelp">Posting on Piazza</a> page.
- **Student hours:** Course organisers will hold students hours on Thursdays in person. Please feel free to call in with any questions!
- **MathsBase:** MathsBase is our drop-in support centre which allows you to talk to a tutor about most of our year 1 and year 2 courses in Mathematics. 

<!--The tutors which staff it will usually be available to help between 9am and 6pm Monday to Friday. You’re welcome to join to discuss questions you have on the course material, both with classmates and with the tutor. To access MathsBase you should find you are already added to the MathsBase team on Microsoft Teams - and this is where you can access the MathsBase support. Make sure you can share screen or a photo of the problem you are working on. Find the ‘General’ channel of the MathsBase team and read the welcome message. Reply to that message with a note of which course you are wanting help with. Go to the course channel for that course and join or start a meeting to wait for the tutor. Whilst you are there you can talk to other students from the course who might also be waiting too. You might find that others have similar questions.-->

  MathsBase support for IDS is more limited than other first year courses and you may find a limited number of hours are available with tutors for this course.

- **Email:** Please do not use email for any course content questions (those should go on Piazza), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for a public forum (e.g. illness, concessions).

- For more general support and advice, please make use of the following resources:
  <ul>
    <li>Your personal tutor (especially if you are struggling in general).</li>
    <li>Student learning advisor for the course.</li>
    <li><a = id="IAD">Institute for Academic Development</a>: Online events and support.</li>
    <li><a = id="Advice">The Advice Place</a>: Open for phone and email advice.</li>
    <li><a = id="Disability">Student Disability Service</a>.</li>
  </ul>

Make good use of this support system, it is there for you! And if you're not sure where to go for help, just ask any academic or administrative member of the course team.
