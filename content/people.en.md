    <p style= "text-align: left; font-size: 1.2vw; overflow:hidden;"><em>My pronouns are he/him.</em>  I am University Teacher in Statistics at the School of Mathematics, at the University of Edinburgh, and a part-time lecturer TED University. Previously, I held postdoc positions at Padova University (2021) and KU Leuven (2020), after completing my PhD at Middle East Technical University in 2018. I am very interested in using statistical modelling to help people solve real-life problems - a crucial part of that is being able to extract the key messages from datasets and communicate those to non-statisticians!</p>

    <p style= "text-align: left; font-size: 1.2vw; overflow:hidden;"><em>My pronouns are he/him.</em> I am a University Teacher in Statistics in the School of Mathematics. My work focuses on teaching statistics and data science to undergraduate and Master’s students. I have a varied background in statistical research: from applied investigations into Alzheimer's research to computational intensive methods in statistics. Currently, my research is in a branch of time series analysis (where data are measured in sequential order over time) called changepoint analysis where we would like to estimate the point in time where the underlying mechanism generating the data shifts from one regime to another. My interest in data science as a subject goes far beyond the tediousness of computing standard statistics like means, variances and correlations. Rather, to me, data science is about the process of discovering the data's story, and begin able to communicate its story to others with accuracy, robustness and impartiality.</p>
