These weekly multiple choice quizzes will help you evaluate your learning continuously. These assignments will be completed __individually__. The online quiz with the lowest score for each student will be dropped. 

The links to the weekly quiz will be available on the LEARN ULTRA on a Monday. You can use this item to work through the quiz questions alongside the code, if you need. Mainly, for the performance tracking, we are using different question types on the LEARN ULTRA page. 

When you finish, you need to complete your submission in the LEARN ULTRA environment so that it is available for grading by the lecturers. Upon completing the submission, at a later time, you will be able to exercise solutions and your marking in an automated way.
